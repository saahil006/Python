### Inheritance
It is used for having an extra attributes which will not be relevant if added in parent class. But we still need all the
attributes and methods of parent class

#### self.__class __.__name __
This gives the name of the class

#### super.__init __()
It lets us use parent class constructor and access all the attributes and functions of parent class.
